   * Ensures accurate attendance monitoring without manual input.

3. **Performance Metrics**

   * Tracks task completion progress and displays analytical reports.
   * Utilizes **Chart.js** for data visualization and performance analytics.

4. **Leave Management**

   * Workers can apply for leave through the platform.
   * Leave data automatically updates the attendance and performance dashboard.




##  Key Functionalities

* Real-time synchronization of attendance and task data.
* Interactive dashboards for admins and workers.
